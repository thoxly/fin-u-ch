- **Worker App**: Automated salary operation generation (monthly cron job)
- **Caching**: Redis-based report caching with TTL
- **Multi-tenancy**: Full data isolation by companyId
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI with most endpoints documented

#### Frontend

- **Pages**: All major pages implemented (Dashboard, Operations, Plans, Reports, Catalogs)
- **Components**: Complete UI component library with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Implemented Features**

#### Soft Delete

- **Status**: Database schema includes `deletedAt` fields
- **Issue**: Services perform hard deletes, not using soft delete functionality
- **Impact**: Data recovery not possible after deletion

#### API Documentation

- **Status**: Most endpoints documented in Swagger
- **Issue**: Some catalog endpoints lack complete Swagger documentation
- **Impact**: Incomplete API documentation for some endpoints

### ‚ùå **Not Implemented Features**

#### Recurrence System

- **Status**: No separate recurrence table or templates
- **Current**: Recurring patterns handled directly in PlanItem.repeat field
- **Impact**: Limited flexibility for complex recurring patterns

#### Advanced User Management

- **Status**: Basic user management only
- **Missing**: Roles, permissions, user profiles
- **Impact**: No granular access control

#### Import/Export

- **Status**: No import/export functionality
- **Missing**: Bank statement import, data export
- **Impact**: Manual data entry only

#### Notifications System

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented
- **Features**: Complete notification system with Redux store and UI components
- **Types**: Success, error, warning, info notifications
- **Features**: Auto-dismiss, manual dismiss, stack management, animations

#### Advanced Permissions

- **Status**: Only company-level isolation
- **Missing**: Department-level, user-level permissions
- **Impact**: All users in company have same access

## Database Schema vs Documentation

### ‚úÖ **Accurate Documentation**

- Core entity relationships
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Indexing strategy
- Field types and constraints

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Documentation Discrepancies**

- Some field descriptions were outdated
- Missing optional field indicators
- Incomplete relationship descriptions

### üìù **Updates Made**

- Corrected field optionality indicators
- Updated entity descriptions to match actual schema
- Added missing relationship information
- Clarified implementation status of features

## Code Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Strengths**

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Testing**: Unit tests for critical services
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with custom AppError
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Winston
- **Validation**: Input validation for all endpoints
- **Security**: JWT authentication, password hashing, CORS protection

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Areas for Improvement**

- **Test Coverage**: Limited test coverage for some modules
- **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more descriptive
- **Code Documentation**: Limited inline documentation
- **Frontend Charts**: Dashboard charts are placeholders (need recharts library)
- **Plan vs Fact UI**: Plan values in CashflowTable are calculated as placeholders

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Implement Soft Delete**: Update services to use `deletedAt` fields
2. **Complete API Documentation**: Add Swagger docs for remaining endpoints
3. **Add Test Coverage**: Increase test coverage for critical paths

### Medium Priority

1. **Implement Notifications**: Complete the notifications system
2. **Add Import/Export**: Implement data import/export functionality
3. **Enhance User Management**: Add roles and permissions

### Low Priority

1. **Advanced Recurrence**: Implement more flexible recurrence patterns
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries and caching
3. **UI Enhancements**: Improve user experience and accessibility

## Conclusion

The fin-u-ch project has a solid foundation with most core functionality implemented and working. The main gaps are in advanced features like user management, notifications, and import/export capabilities. The codebase is well-structured and follows good practices, making it suitable for production use with the current feature set.

The documentation has been updated to accurately reflect the current implementation status, and this report provides a clear roadmap for future development priorities.
