   - **Documentation**: Not mentioned in UI features section

2. **Company UI Settings**
   - **Implementation**: Full API endpoints and functionality
   - **Documentation**: Mentioned but not detailed

3. **Error Handling**
   - **Implementation**: Comprehensive error handling in DDS report
   - **Documentation**: Not documented

## Features with TODO/Incomplete Implementation

### High Priority

1. **Dashboard Charts**
   - **Location**: `apps/web/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx:149`
   - **Issue**: Chart placeholder text "требует библиотеку recharts"
   - **Impact**: Core dashboard functionality incomplete

2. **Plan vs Fact in CashflowTable**
   - **Location**: `apps/web/src/widgets/CashflowTable/CashflowTable.tsx:189, 348`
   - **Issue**: Plan calculations marked as TODO
   - **Impact**: Plan vs Fact comparison not working in main report

### Medium Priority

1. **Article Hierarchy UI**
   - **Issue**: Schema supports hierarchy but UI doesn't
   - **Impact**: Cannot create article trees in interface

2. **Advanced Permissions**
   - **Issue**: Only companyId-based isolation
   - **Impact**: No role-based access control

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Add recharts dependency** to implement dashboard charts
2. **Complete plan calculations** in CashflowTable widget
3. **Update documentation** to reflect current UI component library
4. **Document authentication flow** in detail

### Future Enhancements

1. **Implement article hierarchy UI**
2. **Add soft delete functionality**
3. **Implement notification system features**
4. **Add role-based permissions**

## Documentation Updates Made

1. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md**: Added new UI features and components
2. **API.md**: Enhanced Worker App documentation with detailed features
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Added section for partially implemented features
4. **DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md**: This comprehensive summary

## Conclusion

The project has significantly more implemented features than documented. The core functionality is solid, but several UI enhancements and documentation updates are needed. The most critical gaps are in dashboard visualization and plan vs fact calculations in reports.

The codebase shows good architecture with comprehensive testing, dark mode support, and responsive design. The worker app is particularly well-implemented with proper error handling and logging.
